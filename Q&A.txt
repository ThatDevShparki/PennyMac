Is the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?

Yes, the way I wrote the second program is definitely influenced by the first. Since both the programs required reading and processing a files data thats in a .dat format. Both programs also had requirements to find the minimum from a data set after doing some computation and applying similar logic.
